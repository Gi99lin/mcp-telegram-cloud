/**
 * issue #19 — the deadline primitive itself.
 *
 * These are the properties the rest of the fix leans on: a breach rejects with a typed
 * error, a late rejection after the breach cannot kill the process, and the happy path
 * leaves no armed timer behind (otherwise every tool call would keep the event loop busy
 * for its full budget).
