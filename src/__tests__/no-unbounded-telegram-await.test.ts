/**
 * issue #19 guard — every await that reaches GramJS must be bounded.
 *
 * The behavioural tests prove today's paths are bounded. This one is about tomorrow: the
 * bug was not a wrong line of code, it was an easy-to-add one. A new `await
 * telegram.ensureConnected()` inside `SessionManager` re-pins the per-user lock and
 * resurrects the exact wedge users reported, while every existing test stays green.
 *
 * Source-level on purpose: there is no runtime seam that can observe "someone awaited the
 * network without a deadline". Renaming the import does not defeat it, because it matches
 * the Telegram call sites, not the deadline helper.
 *
 * REVIEW FINDING (Copilot, first pass): the first version of this guard could pass
 * vacuously — a comment containing the word `withDeadline` above an unbounded call was
 * accepted as proof of boundedness, and a call split across lines was not seen at all.
 * Comments and strings are therefore stripped before scanning, the call regex tolerates
 * line breaks, and the scanner itself is unit-tested against synthetic offenders below.
