/**
 * Guard for the 10-second cliff (found 2026-09-21).
 *
 * `Bun.serve()` defaults `idleTimeout` to 10s; the MCP SDK's SSE keep-alive
 * defaults to 15s. With both defaults in force, every quiet `/mcp` stream was
 * killed by the socket layer before its first heartbeat and surfaced to clients
 * as a Traefik-synthesized 500 (4617 of them in one week, all with p50 duration
 * 10.34s). Nothing in the behavioural test suite could see it: the handler had
 * already returned 200, and the failure happened below the application.
 *
 * So this guard is deliberately source-level and value-level:
 *  - the two constants must keep a safe ratio (a config-only regression);
 *  - `Bun.serve` must actually be called with the idle timeout, and the MCP
 *    transport with the keep-alive (a wiring-only regression — the constants
 *    could stay perfect while nobody passes them).
