/**
 * issue #19 — the permanent wedge.
 *
 * Reported symptom: after some Telegram hiccup, one user's tool calls hang forever;
 * reinstalling the connector, redoing OAuth and waiting past the idle reaper all fail to
 * recover them, and only a container restart helps.
 *
 * Mechanism (pre-v2.59.0): `getOrCreateSessionImpl` / `ensureActiveSession` awaited GramJS
 * `ensureConnected()` INSIDE `withLock(userId, …)`. A half-open socket makes that promise
 * never settle, so the per-user lock chain is pinned and every later call for that user
 * queues behind it forever. Nothing outside process memory is involved — which is exactly
 * why re-auth could not fix it.
 *
 * These tests fail (by hanging into the runner's timeout) without the deadlines.
