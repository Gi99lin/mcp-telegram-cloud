/**
 * Socket-level timeouts for the HTTP server and the MCP SSE streams that live on it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (measured 2026-09-21, one month of production data):
 * `Bun.serve()` defaults `idleTimeout` to 10 SECONDS, while the MCP SDK's
 * streamable-HTTP transport sends its SSE keep-alive comment every 15 seconds
 * (`DEFAULT_SSE_KEEP_ALIVE_MS`). The heartbeat therefore never arrived in time:
 * Bun killed every quiet `/mcp` stream at the 10s mark, Traefik saw the upstream
 * connection drop mid-response and synthesized a 500 "Internal Server Error"
 * (21-byte body) for the client. Evidence: 4617 `GET /mcp` 500s in 7 days with
 * p50 duration 10.34s / max 12.08s, against p50 0.15s for clean 200s — a flat
 * cliff at the default, not a load effect. Clients reconnected, so nothing was
 * user-visible, but ~19% of all notification streams churned and the noise
 * masked real failures.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: the keep-alive must fire comfortably before the socket is
 * considered idle. Both numbers are pinned here rather than inherited — an SDK
 * bump that changes its default must not be able to reintroduce the cliff, and
 * `src/__tests__/http-timeouts.test.ts` fails if the margin is ever lost.

/**
 * Bun socket idle timeout, in SECONDS (Bun's unit; hard maximum is 255).
 * Chosen well above the keep-alive so a stream only dies when the peer is
 * genuinely gone, not because it had nothing to say for a while.
