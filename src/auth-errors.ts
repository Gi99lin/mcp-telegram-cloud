/**
 * The one list of Telegram errors that mean "this session is dead, not just unlucky".
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHARED (issue #19 review finding): `tool-registry.ts` used this list to decide
 * whether to revoke OAuth, while `session-manager.ts` decided whether to DELETE the stored
 * `session_string` from a plain boolean — `TelegramService.connect()` returns `false` for
 * network failures just as it does for a revoked auth key. A transient stall therefore
 * looked exactly like a revoked session and logged the user out permanently, which is a
 * worse outcome than the wedge this change set is fixing.
 *
 * The rule: destroy persisted credentials ONLY on positive evidence from Telegram that they
 * are invalid. Silence, timeouts and network errors are not evidence.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: `AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED`. It means "this key is in use by another
 * connection", i.e. a live, valid session — deleting it would turn a recoverable collision
 * into a forced re-login.

 * re-authenticate.").
 *
 * Matching only the uppercase tokens therefore produced the OPPOSITE failure of the one we
 * were fixing (review finding): a genuinely revoked session was never recognised, its row
 * was kept forever and every later call retried an auth key Telegram had already thrown
 * away. Deliberately narrow so "Network error: …" and "Connection marked unhealthy: …"
 * — the other two sentences upstream writes — keep the credentials.
