/**
 * Canonical "where does the authorization code actually go" key.
 *
 * WHY ORIGIN AND NOT client_id: every real MCP client re-registers constantly —
 * measured on prod 2026-09-21, one deployment held 727 `Claude` client rows, 98
 * `Cursor`, 66 `Google Antigravity`, all pointing at the same few callback URLs.
 * A consent record keyed by `client_id` would therefore expire on every
 * reconnect and put a confirmation screen in front of every returning user,
 * while a record keyed by the callback destination survives re-registration.
 * It is also the more honest security boundary: the code is delivered to this
 * origin, so this is the party being trusted — the `client_id` is just a label
 * anyone can mint via open RFC 7591 registration.
 *
 * Returns `null` only for input that cannot be parsed as a URL; callers treat
 * that as "never auto-approve".
