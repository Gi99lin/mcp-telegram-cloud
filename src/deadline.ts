/**
 * Bounded waits for anything that talks to Telegram.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #19): before v2.59.0 nothing on the tool-call path had a
 * deadline. `requireConnection` → `SessionManager.ensureActiveSession` →
 * `withLock(userId, …)` → GramJS `ensureConnected()` were all unbounded awaits, so a
 * half-open MTProto socket did not merely make one call slow — it pinned the per-user
 * lock chain forever, and every later call by that user queued behind a promise that
 * would never settle. Reinstalling the connector or redoing OAuth could not clear it,
 * because the wedge lives in process memory, not in tokens or SQLite. Measured on
 * production before the fix: 76 tool calls over 7 days ran longer than 60s, the worst
 * finishing after 48.8 minutes.
 *
 * WHAT A DEADLINE IS NOT: JavaScript promises are not cancellable, so `withDeadline`
 * does **not** abort the underlying Telegram work. It only stops *us* waiting on it.
 * A timed-out `telegram-send-message` may still deliver the message. That asymmetry is
 * why the default budget is deliberately generous (minutes, not seconds) — we only cut
 * calls that are already lost to the MCP client anyway, and callers must treat a
 * timeout as "unknown outcome", never as "did not happen".

 *
 * The timer is always cleared, including on the happy path, so a long-lived server does
